# The-Books-Library

The goal is to generate automatically an HTML page that lists the name, author and genre of a book. 
The only parameter needed is the name of the book.

To use the script, type:

```
$ python book_libray.py "Name of a book"
```

Example:

```
$ python book_library.py "Les Mis√©rables"
```
